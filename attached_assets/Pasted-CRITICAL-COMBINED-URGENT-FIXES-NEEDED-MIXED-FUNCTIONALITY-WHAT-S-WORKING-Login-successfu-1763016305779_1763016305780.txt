CRITICAL: COMBINED URGENT FIXES NEEDED - MIXED FUNCTIONALITY

✅ WHAT'S WORKING:
- Login successful
- News CRUD working (including images displaying)
- Contact form working
- Media creation working (but thumbnails broken)
- Basic uploads working

🚨 WHAT'S STILL BROKEN:

1. **Events API** - 400 Bad Request error
2. **Member States** - Edit shows empty form, logo not displaying on frontend
3. **Media** - YouTube thumbnails not generating, external links broken
4. **Leaders** - Uploaded images not displaying, update removes existing image
5. **Clubs** - Not creating at all
6. **Players** - Images not displaying, update doesn't show existing data
7. **All Edit Forms** - Not pre-populating with existing data
8. **IMAGE DISPLAY PIPELINE BROKEN** - Uploaded images not showing in frontend (except news)

🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- News images work → Other images should work too
- Upload succeeds → But frontend display fails
- Edit forms empty → Data not being fetched properly

🔧 REQUIRED COMPLETE FIXES:

PHASE 1: FIX DATA FLOW
1. **Fix Events API** - Resolve 400 Bad Request
2. **Fix All Edit Forms** - Pre-populate with existing data including images
3. **Fix Clubs Creation** - Make clubs create properly

PHASE 2: FIX IMAGE SYSTEM
4. **Fix Image Display Pipeline** - Upload → Store URL → API returns URL → Frontend displays
5. **Verify Image URLs** - Check database storage and frontend retrieval
6. **Fix YouTube Thumbnails** - Generate and display for external media

PHASE 3: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING
7. **Test ALL CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete for every entity
8. **Test ALL Image Uploads** - Ensure upload → storage → display works end-to-end
9. **Verify Data Persistence** - Changes must survive page refresh

🎯 PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix Events API (blocking)
2. Fix Image Display (critical user experience)
3. Fix Edit Forms (admin usability)
4. Fix YouTube Thumbnails (media functionality)
5. Fix Clubs Creation (missing feature)

NO MORE PARTIAL FIXES. Since News images work, use that as reference to fix ALL other image displays. Test and fix EVERY component completely end-to-end.
