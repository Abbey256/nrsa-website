# Nigeria Rope Skipping Federation (NRSF) Website

## Overview

The Nigeria Rope Skipping Federation (NRSF) website is an official sports federation platform built to promote and manage rope skipping competitions across Nigeria. The application serves as the central hub for athletes, clubs, events, news, and media related to the sport. It features the innovative Y-Court three-team competition system and provides registration capabilities for clubs and players.

The platform is designed with a strong Nigerian national identity (green, white, and black color scheme) while maintaining international sports federation standards. It targets athletes, coaches, club managers, and sports enthusiasts across Nigeria.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool and development server.

**Routing**: Wouter - a lightweight client-side routing library chosen for its minimal footprint and simplicity over React Router.

**UI Component System**: Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS for styling. The design system follows the "new-york" style variant with a neutral base color and extensive use of CSS variables for theming. Components are configured with path aliases for clean imports.

**State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) v5 for server state management, providing caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates. No global client state management library is used - component-level state with hooks is sufficient.

**Styling Approach**: Tailwind CSS utility-first framework with custom design tokens defined in CSS variables. The color system uses HSL values with alpha channel support for consistent theming. Custom utility classes include `hover-elevate` and `active-elevate-2` for interactive elevation effects.

**Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod for schema validation via @hookform/resolvers.

**Design Philosophy**: Reference-based approach inspired by international sports federation websites (ijru.sport, ropeskippingsport.org) while incorporating Nigerian national identity. The design emphasizes official legitimacy, dynamic energy, and international standards.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js running on Node.js with TypeScript.

**API Design**: RESTful API endpoints organized under `/api/*` routes. File-based JSON storage for simplicity, with data stored in `client/public/data/` directory (news.json, events.json, players.json, clubs.json).

**Session Management**: The codebase includes connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage, suggesting session-based authentication capability.

**File Upload**: Multer middleware configured for handling file uploads with a 5MB limit, storing files in `client/public/uploads/`.

**Email Integration**: Nodemailer configured for SMTP email sending (optional, only initialized if SMTP credentials are provided via environment variables).

**Storage Pattern**: Custom storage abstraction layer (`server/storage.ts`) implementing an IStorage interface that reads/writes JSON files. This provides a consistent API for CRUD operations on news articles, events, players, clubs, and registration submissions.

**Development Tooling**: Custom Vite middleware integration for hot module replacement in development. Production builds bundle the server code with esbuild.

### Database Strategy

**Current Implementation**: File-based JSON storage for all entities (news, events, players, clubs, registrations).

**Database Configuration Present**: Drizzle ORM is configured with PostgreSQL dialect pointing to a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. The schema is defined in `shared/schema.ts` with migrations configured to output to `./migrations` directory.

**Migration Path**: The application is architected to support database migration from JSON files to PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM. The schema definitions use Zod for runtime validation, which can be used alongside Drizzle's schema definitions.

### Data Models

**Core Entities** (defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Zod schemas):

- **NewsArticle**: Articles with title, date, description, optional image/content
- **Event**: Competitions with title, date, venue, description, optional image, and competition type (Standard, Sub-Standard, Open, Grand Master)
- **Player**: Athlete profiles with name, club, state, total points, awards, optional profile photo and NRSF ID
- **Club**: Registered clubs with name, city, state, manager details, contact info, optional email and founding year
- **ClubRegistration**: New club registration submissions
- **PlayerRegistration**: New player registration submissions  
- **ContactForm**: Contact form submissions

### Authentication & Authorization

**Admin Authentication**: Simple password-based authentication using environment variable `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (defaults to "nrsf2024admin"). This is acknowledged in comments as needing proper authentication for production.

**Session Infrastructure**: Connect-pg-simple package included for PostgreSQL-backed session storage, indicating planned session-based authentication system.

**Current State**: No user authentication system is fully implemented - admin password is used for basic protection of admin endpoints.

### File Organization

**Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with clear separation:
- `client/` - Frontend React application
- `server/` - Backend Express application  
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- `client/public/` - Static assets and JSON data files

**Path Aliases**:
- `@/` → `client/src/`
- `@shared/` → `shared/`
- `@assets/` → `attached_assets/`

### Build & Deployment

**Development**: `npm run dev` runs server with tsx for TypeScript execution
**Build**: `npm run build` creates production bundles - Vite build for frontend, esbuild for backend
**Production**: `npm start` runs the bundled server from `dist/index.js`
**Database**: `npm run db:push` pushes Drizzle schema changes to database

**Environment Variables Required**:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (if using database)
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE` - Email configuration (optional)
- `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS` - Email credentials (optional)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Admin authentication (optional, defaults to "nrsf2024admin")
