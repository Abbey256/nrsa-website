URGENT: COMPLETE SYSTEM FIX REQUIRED - MULTIPLE CRITICAL BUGS

🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. **toSnakeCase FUNCTION BUG** - Converting Date objects to `{}` breaking ALL date operations
2. **SCHEMA CONFLICTS** - Drizzle-Zod schemas conflicting with direct Supabase client usage
3. **CLUBS CREATION BLOCKED** - 'manager_name' column error despite column existing in database
4. **IMAGE DISPLAY PIPELINE BROKEN** - Images upload but don't display in frontend (except News)
5. **EVENTS API FAILING** - Date handling issues causing 400 errors
6. **EDIT FORMS EMPTY** - Not pre-populating with existing data
7. **YOUTUBE THUMBNAILS BROKEN** - External media links not generating previews

🎯 IMMEDIATE COMPREHENSIVE FIXES REQUIRED:

**PHASE 1: FIX CORE INFRASTRUCTURE**
1. **Fix toSnakeCase Function** - Preserve Date objects, don't convert to {}
2. **Remove Drizzle-Zod Dependencies** - Replace with manual Zod schemas
3. **Fix All Date Handling** - Events, News, and other date-based operations

**PHASE 2: FIX DATA FLOW**
4. **Fix Clubs Creation** - Manual schema validation for clubs
5. **Fix All Edit Forms** - Ensure they fetch and display existing data
6. **Fix Image Display Pipeline** - Debug why images save but don't show in frontend

**PHASE 3: FIX USER EXPERIENCE**
7. **Fix YouTube Thumbnails** - Generate proper previews for external media
8. **Test ALL CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete for every entity
9. **Verify Image Upload → Storage → Display** - End-to-end testing

🔧 TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- **SIMPLIFY** - Remove complex schema generators, use manual validation
- **USE NEWS AS REFERENCE** - News works perfectly, replicate its patterns everywhere
- **TEST EACH FIX** - Don't move to next issue until current one is verified working
- **END-TO-END VERIFICATION** - Test complete user workflows, not just API calls

🎯 PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix toSnakeCase Date bug (BLOCKING)
2. Fix Clubs creation with manual schema
3. Fix image display pipeline
4. Fix Events API date handling
5. Fix all edit forms data pre-population
6. Fix YouTube thumbnails
7. Comprehensive testing of ALL functionality

NO MORE PARTIAL FIXES. I need the ENTIRE system working end-to-end. Test every feature thoroughly before completing.

The system was more stable with direct Supabase queries and manual validation. Revert to that approach and fix all remaining issues completely.
