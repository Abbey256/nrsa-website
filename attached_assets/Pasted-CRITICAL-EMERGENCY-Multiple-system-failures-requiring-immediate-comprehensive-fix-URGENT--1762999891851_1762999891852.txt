CRITICAL EMERGENCY: Multiple system failures requiring immediate comprehensive fix:

## 🚨 URGENT PROBLEM 1: SUPABASE AUTHENTICATION BROKEN
- Supabase auth returning: `{ data: 'success', error: 'Invalid API key' }`
- Admin login failing with "Invalid credentials" despite correct password
- ALL authentication broken due to invalid API key

## 🚨 URGENT PROBLEM 2: ADMIN PORTAL COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY BREAKDOWN
1. **Contact Form Broken** - Not sending data to backend, returns errors
2. **CRUD Operations Failed** - Create, Edit, Delete not working on most pages
3. **Admin Creation Broken** - Cannot create new admin accounts
4. **File Upload Failed** - All uploads returning "fail" errors
5. **Data Sync Issues** - Items show "created" but don't appear in frontend
6. **Leaders Delete Works** but Edit/Create broken
7. **Inconsistent API Responses** - Some return success but no actual changes

## 🔧 REQUIRED COMPREHENSIVE FIXES:

**PHASE 1: FIX AUTHENTICATION FIRST**
1. **Fix Supabase API Key Configuration** - Update environment variables with valid keys
2. **Verify Supabase Project Connection** - Ensure correct URL and service keys
3. **Test Authentication End-to-End** - Login must work with admin@nrsa.com.ng

**PHASE 2: FIX ADMIN PORTAL FUNCTIONALITY**
1. **Fix ALL API Endpoints** - Ensure proper request/response handling
2. **Repair Database Operations** - Insert, update, delete queries across all tables
3. **Fix File Upload System** - Resolve multipart form data and storage issues
4. **Debug Contact Form** - Frontend submission to backend processing
5. **Verify Data Persistence** - Ensure created items actually save to database
6. **Fix Admin Creation Flow** - Super admin should be able to create new admins
7. **Test Complete CRUD Cycle** for every entity: Leaders, News, Events, Players, Clubs, Media, Contacts

## 🎯 TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Login must work with: admin@nrsa.com.ng / nrsa@Admin2024!
- No "Invalid API key" errors in logs
- JWT tokens generated successfully
- Test EVERY admin portal function end-to-end
- Verify data appears in frontend after creation
- Confirm edits persist after refresh
- Ensure deletes actually remove data
- Validate file uploads work and store properly
- Test contact form sends and stores data correctly

## 🚀 PRIORITY ORDER:
1. FIX SUPABASE API KEYS & AUTHENTICATION (BLOCKING ISSUE)
2. FIX ALL ADMIN PORTAL CRUD OPERATIONS
3. FIX FILE UPLOAD SYSTEM
4. FIX CONTACT FORM
5. VERIFY ALL FUNCTIONALITY END-TO-END

Please perform complete system diagnostics and fix ALL issues systematically. Authentication must be fixed first as it's blocking all other functionality.
